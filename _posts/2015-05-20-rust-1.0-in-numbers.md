[Rust 1.0](http://blog.rust-lang.org/2015/05/15/Rust-1.0.html) was
made with[^methodology]…

<style>
.number { text-align: right; }
table { max-width: 600px; border-spacing: 0 0.4em; border-collapse: separate; }
td { vertical-align: top; }
</style>

<table>{% for thing in page.things %}<tr><td class="number">{{ thing[0] }}</td><td class="thing">{{ thing[1] | markdownify | replace: '<p>','' | replace: '</p>','' }}</td></tr>{% endfor %}</table>

Happy 1.0!


[^methodology]: I've tried to get the numbers that apply leading up to
                the 1.0 release exactly, e.g. using the exact tag of
                the release for code related things, and generally
                trying to show the value as it was on/before
                May 15. I've put a ~ on particularly dubious numbers
                and those for which I can't get the true 1.0 value,
                but most probably have too many significant figures
                anyway: this definitely isn't meant to be at all
                scientific.
