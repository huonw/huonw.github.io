[Rust 1.0](http://blog.rust-lang.org/2015/05/15/Rust-1.0.html) was
made with[^methodology]…

<style>
.number { text-align: right }
table { max-width: 600px; border-spacing: 0 0.4em; border-collapse: separate; }
td { vertical-align: top; }
</style>

<table>{% for thing in page.things %}<tr><td class="number">{{ thing[0] }}</td><td class="thing">{{ thing[1] | markdownify | replace: '<p>','' | replace: '</p>','' }}</td></tr>{% endfor %}</table>

Happy 1.0!


[^methodology]: I've tried to get the numbers that apply leading up to
                the 1.0 release exactly, e.g. using the exact tag of
                the release for code related things, and generally
                trying to show the value as it was on/before
                May 15. Most of the numbers probably have too many
                significant figures anyway, but I've put a ~ on
                particularly dubious ones and those for which I can't
                get the true 1.0 value.)
