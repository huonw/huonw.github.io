[Rust Sydney](http://meetup.com/Rust-Sydney) had its first event last
Monday!  The first Rust gathering I know of in Sydney, in Australia,
or in the whole southern hemisphere.

I had fun meeting all sorts of people interested in Rust: some who'd
dived in deep already, some who'd only recently started playing with
it, and some who'd been following for a while but had unfortunately
not got time to actually use it (hopefully soon!).

Thanks to everyone who came and, to
[Envoy Advanced Technologies](http://envoyat.com) for providing the
space and drinks, free of charge.


I started off with a brief talk, covering where Rust is now (and
[will be soon](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/22319)), built
around the haiku:

> a systems language<br/>
> pursuing the trifecta<br/>
> safe, concurrent, fast

[My slides are online](http://huonw.github.io/rust-sydney-feb15/),
although there's no recording so they may not be so interesting. But
you *can* get the human part of the experience by imagining this
picture of me is moving.

(I was fortunate enough to schedule the meetup when Servo developer
[Simon Sapin](https://twitter.com/SimonSapin) happened to be in
Sydney; he took all three photos in this article.)

I wrapped up and handed over to Steve Klabnik: he was in town for a
conference and was the reason I was prompted into organising
something, so Rust Sydney could start with a bang. We got a reprisal
of his FOSDEM talk
["The story of Rust"](https://fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/the_story_of_rust/)
which was a really interesting overview of Rust since beginning as a
Graydon Hoare's personal project around 2007, up until the
[impending 1.0](http://blog.rust-lang.org/2015/02/13/Final-1.0-timeline.html)
release. [His slides](http://www.steveklabnik.com/fosdem2015/) (use
left/right arrow keys to navigate) are also online, and hopefully the
recording from FOSDEM will appear in the near future.

It was pleasantly surprising to see how many people were interested
enough in Rust to come to a meetup, at least 30. More than I had
expected and I didn't even do much advertising. It was awesome!

I'll be trying to organise more events, so be sure sign up to
[Rust Sydney](http://meetup.com/Rust-Sydney) to keep track (although I
will post to [users.r-l.o](http://users.rust-lang.org) and
[/r/rust](http://reddit.com/r/rust) too). I hope to see you there.

(I have a [`rust-sydney`](https://github.com/huonw/rust-sydney/)
repository for collecting related things.)
