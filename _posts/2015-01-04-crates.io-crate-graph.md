[Rust](http://rust-lang.org/) is a systems programming language that
comes with an awesome package manager [Cargo](http://doc.crates.io),
which hooks into the [crates.io](https://crates.io) registry as one of
its possible sources of packages. The packages can have dependency
relationships between each other, making the database into a natural
directed graph.

Rust as we have it today is still relatively new, Cargo is even newer,
and crates.io is newer still, so
[the package ecosystem is small](http://www.modulecounts.com): at the
time of writing, only 681 crates exist on crates.io (compared to 115
thousand for node.js' [npm](https://npmjs.org)). I'm sure this will
quickly pick up with as Rust
[moves to 1.0](http://blog.rust-lang.org/2014/12/12/1.0-Timeline.html)
and beyond, but at the moment the network of crates and their
dependencies is still easily small enough to be handled globally with
simple means like the graphviz suite of tools and naive Rust
programs. Which is exactly what I did.


## The graphs

The "full" graph of the ecosystem, as rendered by graphviz's `fdp`, is
busy, very busy:

[![Most packages](most-packages-preview.png)](most-packages.svg)

Click for the rest of the much larger graph as an SVG with clickable
package names, sized according to the number of dependent
packages. You may wish to zoom out to get your bearings.

That's not even the complete package graph: development dependencies
are completely ignored (they can cause cycles), and any crates with no
dependencies and no dependent crates are not shown, since they're not
yet interacting with the ecosystem at all; but even so, the graph is
fairly useless.

The suck is mainly due to the most popular crates like
[`time`](https://crates.io/crates/time/reverse_dependencies) and
[`rustc-serialize`](https://crates.io/crates/rustc-serialize/reverse_dependencies), which
pull most clusters into the very center of the graph. Eliminating them
(specifically, crates with 15 or more dependent crates) gives a more
reasonable graph.

(Click for bigger.)

That graph makes it clearer that there's a few distinct clusters. The
left has a lot of web-development functionality, clustered around
[`hyper`](https://crates.io/crates/hyper),
[`conduit`](https://crates.io/crates/conduit) and
[`openssl`](https://crates.io/crates/openssl). The right has a lot of
game-development and computer graphics libraries, with
[many components](https://crates.io/keywords/piston) (that's not all
of them) from [Piston](http://piston.rs) and many from
[RustAllegro](https://github.com/SiegeLord/RustAllegro). Spread around
are smaller clusters, like
[epsilonz](https://crates.io/crates/epsilonz), and a variety of
numerical projects (of which some
[use `num`](https://crates.io/crates/num/reverse_dependencies),
and [others](https://crates.io/crates/matrix) do not).

It's not a cluster so much, but there are a lot of examples of some
crate `$foo` depending on `$foo-sys`: people following
[the convention for publishing FFI bindings](http://doc.crates.io/build-script.html#*-sys-packages).


## Collecting the data

crates.io uses
[a git repo](https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index) for
distributing information about the registered crates. Each one gets a
file containing a series of JSON objects (one per line) looking a lot
like:

{% highlight json linenos=table %}
{
   "cksum" : "665e3764d2f654d77382ec6ed40a2faf5a114a6e41e2d1c307ff97916924ec64",
   "deps" : [
      {
         "default_features" : true,
         "kind" : "normal",
         "name" : "num",
         "optional" : false,
         "target" : null,
         "req" : "~0",
         "features" : [
            ""
         ]
      }
   ],
   "vers" : "0.1.5",
   "yanked" : false,
   "name" : "slow_primes",
   "features" : {}
}
{% endhighlight %}

That's the info for version 0.1.5 of
[`slow_primes`](https://crates.io/crates/slow_primes); it contains the
key piece of information[^index-works] that we need: the dependencies, in the `deps`
field. The simplistic analysis I'm doing here means that the only
facts of interest are the `name` of the dependency and whether it is a
dev-dependency (`kind == "dev"`).

[^index-works]: Before FreeFall pointed this out, I was considering
                downloading everything on crates.io to construct the
                graph, which would've been pretty fun too!

The fixed format of the JSON makes it ameniable to
`#[derive(RustcDecodable)]`, an attribute that will automatically
create deserialization code that does the right thing:

{% highlight rust linenos=table %}
#[derive(RustcDecodable)]
struct CrateInfo {
    name: String,
    vers: String,
    deps: Vec<DepInfo>,
    cksum: String,
    features: HashMap<String, Vec<String>>,
    yanked: bool,
}

#[derive(RustcDecodable)]
struct DepInfo {
    name: String,
    req: String,
    features: Vec<String>,
    optional: bool,
    default_features: bool,
    target: Option<String>,
    kind: Option<String>
}
{% endhighlight %}

The graph is based on the most recent version of each package, so I
just take the last line in each crate's file, run it through
[`json::decode`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc-serialize/rustc-serialize/json/fn.decode.html)
and get back a `CrateInfo`. A few tens of lines later, the code knows
about every crate and about every dependency link and can print it all
out to a graphviz DOT file. (Unfortunately the neat
[`graphviz`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/graphviz) library
doesn't offer the flexibility I wanted for setting arbitrary
attributes, so I had to resort to manual printing.)

There is one trip-up: a crate can depend on another crate multiple
times, with different configurations (most commonly, differing
`target`s), so some deduplication is required to avoid double counting
and cluttering the graph with multiple lines. Other than that, the
details of the implementation aren't very interesting, but the code is
publicly available at
[github.com/huonw/crates.io-graph](http://github.com/huonw/crates.io-graph).

Thanks to cmr, acrichto, FreeFall and tomaka in #cargo for
help/suggestions/copy-editing/catching bugs.
