Shell scripts sometimes have to append data to a file. Redirecting output with `>>` is the conventional way and works fine, but using `tee -a` instead is a usually better default, especially in continuous integration. It's **just as easy** and gives **automatic introspection**: the same value is printed to stdout and so appears in normal logs too.

{% highlight shell linenos %}
# conventional approach (worse!):
echo "some_variable=some_value" >> "$GITHUB_ENV"
# preferable approach (better!):
echo "some_variable=some_value" | tee -a "$GITHUB_ENV"
{% endhighlight %}

This occurs for me most often in continuous integration (CI), and especially with GitHub Actions. GHA currently exposes four different files to the CI scripts, and appending to them controls features of the runner itself:

- [`$GITHUB_ENV` to set environment variables for future steps][env]
- [`$GITHUB_OUTPUT` to set "outputs" of the step][output]
- [`$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` to add a step summary][summary]
- [`$GITHUB_PATH` to set new `$PATH` entries for future steps][path]

[output]: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/workflow-commands-for-github-actions#setting-an-output-parameter
[summary]: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/workflow-commands-for-github-actions#adding-a-job-summary
[path]: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/workflow-commands-for-github-actions#adding-a-system-path

(This may apply to other CI providers too, but I am not as familiar with them.)

GitHub's docs give examples like the following, to create a environment variable called `JSON_RESPONSE` containing the result of a `curl` invocation. This variable will be available to later steps in the same job.

{% highlight yaml linenos %}
steps:
  - name: Set the value in bash
    id: step_one
    run: |
      {
        echo 'JSON_RESPONSE<<EOF'
        curl https://example.com
        echo EOF
      } >> "$GITHUB_ENV"
{% endhighlight %}

This works fine! But the `$JSON_RESPONSE` environment variable will have a value that isn't obvious from the step definition, and might change from run to run. If a human needs to know what the _actual_ value is for a specific run, they're out of luck. This applies equally well if the workflow has lots of `if` conditions in it, where knowing exactly which decisions were made is very handy.

In either case, maybe a workflow does something unexpected and I have to debug: if the CI UI shows any computed/non-obvious values, it's easier to track down the problem, and not get distracted by red herrings.

## Teelling what's going on

There's a few ways to get more insight into what exactly is happening with these appended command files. Focusing on the `$GITHUB_ENV` example above:

- When setting up the variable, **save into a temporary**, and both print it out manually and append it to the file:

{% highlight shell linenos %}
response=$(curl https://example.com)
echo "response=$response"
{
  echo 'JSON_RESPONSE<<EOF'
  echo "$response"
  echo EOF
} >> "$GITHUB_ENV"
{% endhighlight %}

- After the step that sets the variable, **add extra steps**&mdash;temporary or permanent&mdash;that print the resulting environment variable directly:

{% highlight yaml linenos %}
steps:
  - name: Set the value in bash
    ...
  - name: temporary debugging
    run: |
      echo $JSON_RESPONSE
{% endhighlight %}

- When setting up the variable, **use `tee -a`** instead of `>>`:

{% highlight shell linenos %}
{
  echo 'JSON_RESPONSE<<EOF'
  curl https://example.com
  echo EOF
} | tee -a "$GITHUB_ENV"
{% endhighlight %}


The last one is easy to do, is only a tiny change small change from the original code, and can be used habitually with little effort: any time data is being appended to a "command" file, write the characters `| tee -a` instead of `>>`.

Using `tee -a` **by default** means the exact value is visible when it inevitably turns out to be important, potentially years after it was first added!

Having the values available easily also helps with making changes: either having to decipher the current behaviour of an existing workflow, or just iterating on a new one.

## Teeaching what it does

"[The `tee` utility][tee] copies standard input to standard output, making a copy in zero or more files [passed as CLI arguments]". By the default, it overwrites those files, while the `-a` flag switches it to appending instead.

Here's a demo, piping some text into `tee`'s stdin:


[tee]: https://manpage.me/?q=tee

{% highlight shell linenos %}
echo 'hello' | tee -a file.txt
echo 'world' | tee -a file.txt
{% endhighlight %}

Running that prints:

{% highlight text linenos %}
hello
world
{% endhighlight %}

And `file.txt` contains the same contents.

Thus, when we run `... | tee -a $GITHUB_ENV` in our CI environment, we'll both:

- **append** the relevant content to the file at the path stored in the `$GITHUB_ENV` environment variable, same as `>> $GITHUB_ENV`
- **see** it in our CI logs, same as `echo`ing it directly

With the `JSON_RESPONSE` example, the GitHub Actions UI will show[^not-json]:

[^not-json]: This `JSON_RESPONSE` variable is not JSON with the example as written! The use of `tee -a` makes this clear, if that was a cause of a bug.

{% highlight text linenos %}
JSON_RESPONSE<<EOF
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
...
<div>
    <h1>Example Domain</h1>
    <p>This domain is for use in illustrative examples in documents. You may use this
    domain in literature without prior coordination or asking for permission.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.iana.org/domains/example">More information...</a></p>
</div>
</body>
</html>
EOF
{% endhighlight %}

Maybe all that cool [example.com][example] content is particularly popular some day, the site gets crushed under the load, and starts returning 5xx errors. The workflow relying on it then goes off the rails and stops working: knowing the root cause (`example.com` misbehaving leading to bad content in `$JSON_RESPONSE`) will be crucial for any fix.

Using `tee -a`, the root cause will likely be **easy to confirm**, because the output is **already** right there, in the UI.

[example]: https://example.com

## Teempering inappropriate use

There's definitely cases where the "conventional" `>>` might be more sensible, such as:

- If the output is overwhelmingly verbose. This can be managed in other ways, like [grouping log lines][group] or keeping the steps that set such variables focused on _just_ setting those variables and split other work into separate steps.
- If the output contains secrets and so shouldn't be shown in logs. In this case, it's probably best to [register such values for masking][mask] anyway, in case a value is printed accidentally somewhere else.
- If the decisions and outputs are already communicated in other, better ways: `tee -a` is just a quick/good-enough approach especially handy for single-location commands. A reusable script or "action" is more likely to have explicit user-friendly logs.
- If adding `|` piping interferes with the shell's job-control/exit-code-handling in a way that is problematic for the task: piping simple commands like `echo` and `cat` is almost certainly always fine, more complicated commands might need to avoid it[^pipes].

[mask]: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/workflow-commands-for-github-actions#masking-a-value-in-a-log

[^pipes]: I include this case because have an impression that there's some subtleties around piping commands beyond what `set -o pipefail` can handle, but am not sure. This is merely rumour and heresay based on only a vague memory that I haven't been able to confirm or falsify.

## TeeL;DR

In scripts that append to files, especially in CI, consider using `| tee -a $FILE` by default instead of `>> $FILE`.

{% highlight shell linenos %}
# conventional approach (worse!):
echo "some_variable=some_value" >> "$GITHUB_ENV"
# preferable approach (better!):
echo "some_variable=some_value" | tee -a "$GITHUB_ENV"
{% endhighlight %}

This applies to sending CI commands via files, like GitHub Action's `$GITHUB_ENV`, `$GITHUB_OUTPUT` and `$GITHUB_PATH`.
