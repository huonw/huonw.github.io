I'm looking work in software development or related fields. Please
[get in touch](mailto:dbau.pp@gmail.com) if you think my expertise and
experience might suit you:

- [Résumé](resume.pdf).
- [Summary](rust-contributions.pdf) of some of the highlights in my
  involvement with [Rust](https://rust-lang.org).
- I have done [extensive technical blogging](/blog) and
  [educating](http://stackoverflow.com/users/1256624/huon), especially
  about Rust.
- I'm a mathematician/statistician by training, giving me strong
  abstract reasoning skills, and making me comfortable reading and
  [writing](/honours-thesis.pdf) in that style.
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/huon-wilson/).

I have been involved with [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) at a deep
level for several years, but I'm not a one trick pony: I'm
intelligent, eager to learn and very quick to pick up and synthesize
new concepts and ideas. Furthermore, a lot of what I have learned
working with and on Rust applies to many other situations in software
development, both technical and otherwise.
