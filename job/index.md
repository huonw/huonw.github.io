I'm looking for work in software development or related fields. Please
[get in touch](mailto:wilson.huon@gmail.com) if you think my expertise and
experience might suit you:

- [Résumé](resume.pdf).
- [Summary](rust-contributions.pdf) of some of the highlights in my involvement with [Rust](https://rust-lang.org).
- I have done [extensive technical blogging](/blog) and [educating](http://stackoverflow.com/users/1256624/huon), especially about Rust.
- I'm a mathematician/statistician by training, giving me strong abstract reasoning skills, and making me comfortable reading and writing (theses: [Honours](/honours-thesis.pdf), [Masters](/masters-thesis.pdf)) in that style.
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/huon-wilson/).

I have experience across many domains:

- low-level, high systems programming and compiler work via [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) and [Swift](https://swift.org)
- machine learning via the [StellarGraph graph machine learning library](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph) using technologies like TensorFlow
- big data via the [StellarGraph platform](https://www.stellargraph.io/platform), using technologies like Apache HBase and Apache Spark

I'm intelligent, eager to learn and very quick to pick up and synthesize new concepts and ideas. Furthermore, I pride myself on my ability to translate experience and knowledge across domains, using all of my varied background to optimise and improve future work.
