## About me

![](/img/me-larger.jpg)

I'm Huon Wilson, currently a Swift compiler engineer at Apple and
[interested to hear from you](/job). I have degrees in computational
statistics and also pure mathematics. I write code a lot and write
text occasionally. I have done a lot of volunteering on
[the Rust programming language](http://rust-lang.org/), and was on
Rust's core team.

If you're looking to get in touch, I'll respond to `huon` on `#rust`
(etc.) on irc.mozilla.org, [huon_w](http://twitter.com/huon_w) on
twitter or `wilson.huon` at [Google's mail service](http://gmail.com).

If you're looking for code, you can find me on
[GitHub](https://github.com/huonw) and on
[StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/1256624/huon).
