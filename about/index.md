## About me

I'm Huon Wilson, a mathematics student who writes code a lot and text
occasionally. I do a lot of volunteering on
[the Rust programming language](http://rust-lang.org/), and am on
Rust's core team.

If you're looking for code, you can find me on
[GitHub](https://github.com/huonw) and on
[StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/1256624/dbaupp). I
wrote [2048-4D](http://huonw.github.io/2048-4D/), and currently write
a lot of Rust code:

- major items in the main distribution include `std::rand` and
  `#[deriving]`.
- compiler lint plugins for
  [spell-checking documentation](https://github.com/huonw/spellck) and
  [detecting copy-paste errors](https://github.com/huonw/copypasteck)
- a variety of macro plugins (including use<s>less</s>ful ones that handle
  [FRACTRAN](https://github.com/huonw/fractran_macros) and
  [brainfuck](https://github.com/huonw/brainfuck_macros))

[All the gory details](https://github.com/huonw?tab=repositories).

The best way to contact me is email: `d``b``a``u``.``p``p` at
[Google's mail service](http://gmail.com). You can also find me as
`huon` on #rust (etc.) on irc.mozilla.org.
