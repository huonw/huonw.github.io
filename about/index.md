I'm Huon Wilson.  I'm
[interested to hear from you](/job). I have degrees in computational
statistics and also pure mathematics. I write code a lot and write
text occasionally. I [have done a lot of volunteering][rust-prs] on
[the Rust programming language](http://rust-lang.org/), and was on
Rust's core team. I also [worked on the Swift programming
language][swift-prs] as a compiler engineer at Apple, and at [CSIRO's Data61][d61] working
on the [StellarGraph graph machine learning
library][stellar]
