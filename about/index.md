## About me

![](/img/me-larger.jpg)

I'm Huon Wilson, currently a [job-seeking](/job) computational
statistics post-graduate student, previously a computational algebra
honours student. I write code a lot and write text occasionally. I do
a lot of volunteering on
[the Rust programming language](http://rust-lang.org/), and am on
Rust's core team.

If you're looking to get in touch, I'll respond to `huon` on `#rust`
(etc.) on irc.mozilla.org, [huon_w](http://twitter.com/huon_w) on
twitter or `dbau.pp` at [Google's mail service](http://gmail.com).

If you're looking for code, you can find me on
[GitHub](https://github.com/huonw) and on
[StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/1256624/dbaupp). I
wrote [2048-4D](http://huonw.github.io/2048-4D/), and currently write
a lot of Rust code:

- major items in the main distribution include `std::rand` and
  `#[deriving]`.
- compiler lint plugins for
  [spell-checking documentation](https://github.com/huonw/spellck) and
  [detecting copy-paste errors](https://github.com/huonw/copypasteck)
- a variety of macro plugins (including use<s>less</s>ful ones that handle
  [FRACTRAN](https://github.com/huonw/fractran_macros) and
  [brainfuck](https://github.com/huonw/brainfuck_macros))

[All the gory details](https://github.com/huonw?tab=repositories).
